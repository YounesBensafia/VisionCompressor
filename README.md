A powerful Python-based image compression and reconstruction tool that provides efficient compression algorithms while maintaining image quality.

## Features

- **Multiple Processing Modes**:
  - Standard compression mode
  - BGR (Blue-Green-Red) channel processing
  - Y-channel only processing for enhanced efficiency
- **Interactive GUI** for easy image manipulation
- **Batch Processing** capability for multiple images
- **Visual Feedback** with residual image generation
- **Customizable Parameters** for compression quality

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install via requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YounesBensafia/VisionCompressor.git
   cd VisionCompressor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### GUI Interface

Launch the graphical interface for interactive compression:

```bash
python main.py
```
