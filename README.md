# MPEG-video-compression-algorithm

This project implements a simplified version of an MPEG-like video compression pipeline. It demonstrates how spatial and temporal redundancies can be reduced using classical video encoding techniques such as:

* Intra-frame compression (I-frames)

* Inter-frame prediction (P-frames)

* Motion estimation and compensation

* Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and quantization

The goal is to provide a conceptual and practical understanding of how MPEG-style video compression works.
